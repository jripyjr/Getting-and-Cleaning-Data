# Raw Dataset - introduction

We will be using the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (you can have detailed information about each variable here).
Since there are more than 500 variables in the original dataset and the final aim of this project is to create a new tidy dataset based on the original raw dataset we will focus on the transformations needed to create the output dataset. As already mentioned more detailed descriptions about the original measurements from the Human Activity Recognition experimient can be found here.
Raw Dataset - description

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

•	tBodyAcc-XYZ
•	tGravityAcc-XYZ
•	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
•	tBodyGyro-XYZ
•	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
•	tBodyAccMag
•	tGravityAccMag
•	tBodyAccJerkMag
•	tBodyGyroMag
•	tBodyGyroJerkMag
•	fBodyAcc-XYZ
•	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
•	fBodyGyro-XYZ
•	fBodyAccMag
•	fBodyAccJerkMag
•	fBodyGyroMag
•	fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

•	mean(): Mean value
•	std(): Standard deviation
•	mad(): Median absolute deviation
•	max(): Largest value in array
•	min(): Smallest value in array
•	sma(): Signal magnitude area
•	energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
•	iqr(): Interquartile range
•	entropy(): Signal entropy
•	arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
•	correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
•	maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
•	meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
•	skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal
•	kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
•	bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
•	angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
•	gravityMean
•	tBodyAccMean
•	tBodyAccJerkMean
•	tBodyGyroMean
•	tBodyGyroJerkMean

Transformations
1.	The original datasets were separated into three datasets (subject, activity, and measurements) for both training and test.
2.	The subject, activity, and measurements were joined for training and test.
3.	The training and test datasets were joined.
4.	A subset of the resulting dataset is used to keep only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, so we have kept a new reduced dataset with this dimensions (10299 observations of 68 variables)
5.	The labels for activities and variables are extracted and used so that they are more understandable for the users of our output dataset.
6.	The average of each measurement in our dataset grouped by each subject and activity.
